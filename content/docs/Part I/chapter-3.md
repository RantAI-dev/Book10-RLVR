<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Chapter 3 of RLVR delves into the fundamental and practical aspects of bandit algorithms, a crucial component of reinforcement learning that addresses the exploration-exploitation dilemma. The chapter begins with an introduction to the multi-armed bandit problem, where the goal is to maximize cumulative rewards while balancing the trade-off between exploring new actions and exploiting known successful ones. This section lays the groundwork by explaining key metrics like regret and the importance of minimizing it to improve decision-making over time. The chapter then explores greedy and epsilon-greedy algorithms, detailing their mechanisms, strengths, and limitations, while providing practical Rust implementations to observe how different exploration strategies impact long-term performance. Following this, the chapter introduces more sophisticated algorithms such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, both of which offer robust solutions to the exploration-exploitation trade-off through probabilistic and confidence-bound approaches.

# 3.1. Introduction to Bandit Problems
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The multi-armed bandit problem is a cornerstone of decision theory and reinforcement learning (RL), offering a mathematically elegant framework for understanding the trade-offs inherent in sequential decision-making under uncertainty. It captures the fundamental tension between exploration, which involves gathering information about the environment, and exploitation, which leverages existing knowledge to maximize rewards. The problem is named after the analogy of a gambler facing $K$ slot machines ("bandits"), each with an unknown reward distribution. The gambler's goal is to determine, over repeated plays, which machines to play to maximize cumulative rewards.

</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This simplified yet powerful abstraction has numerous real-world applications. For example, in online advertising, a platform must decide which ad to display to a user (the "arm") to maximize click-through rates. Similarly, in clinical trials, researchers aim to allocate treatments to patients to identify the most effective therapy while minimizing harm or wasted resources. By formalizing this dilemma, the bandit problem provides a foundation for developing efficient algorithms that balance learning and reward optimization.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The multi-armed bandit problem is a classic challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), offering a simplified yet powerful framework to study decision-making under uncertainty. Imagine a gambler faced with $K$ slot machines (arms), each with an unknown probability of payout. The gambler must decide which machine to play at each time step, aiming to maximize their cumulative reward over a fixed number of plays. Mathematically, this problem is formalized by associating each arm $k$ with a reward distribution $R_k$. At each time step $t$, the agent selects an arm $A_t \in \{1, 2, \dots, K\}$ and receives a stochastic reward $R_t \sim R_{A_t}$.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The objective is to maximize the total reward:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ G_T = \sum_{t=1}^T R_t, $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
over a horizon of $T$ time steps. However, since the reward distributions are unknown, the agent must navigate the tension between exploration (gathering more information about the arms) and exploitation (choosing the arm with the highest observed reward). This tension lies at the heart of bandit problems and is a critical concept in RL.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In bandit problems, the performance of a strategy (policy) $\pi$ is often evaluated using the concept of regret. Regret quantifies the difference between the cumulative reward of an optimal strategy and the cumulative reward obtained by the chosen strategy:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ R_T = \sum_{t=1}^T \mu^* - \sum_{t=1}^T \mathbb{E}[R_t], $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $\mu^* = \max_k \mu_k$ is the expected reward of the optimal arm, and $\mu_k$ is the expected reward of arm $k$. Regret effectively measures the cost of not always selecting the optimal arm. The goal of bandit algorithms is to minimize regret, ensuring that the strategy learns to approximate the optimal choice over time.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The exploration vs. exploitation dilemma is a central challenge in bandit problems. Exploitation involves selecting the arm that appears most rewarding based on current knowledge, while exploration involves choosing an arm with less certainty to potentially discover better rewards. Mathematically, exploitation corresponds to selecting the arm:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$A_t = \arg\max_k \hat{\mu}_k,$$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $\hat{\mu}_k$ is the estimated mean reward of arm $k$. Exploration, on the other hand, requires introducing randomness into the decision-making process to ensure all arms are sufficiently sampled. Balancing these two goals is crucial, as excessive exploration wastes opportunities to exploit known rewards, while insufficient exploration may prevent the discovery of better arms.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider the analogy of trying to find the best coffee shop in a new city. Exploration involves trying out different cafes, even those that seem less promising, to uncover hidden gems or better alternatives. This phase is driven by curiosity and the need to gather information. Exploitation, on the other hand, means sticking to the coffee shop you already know and enjoy, prioritizing immediate satisfaction. While exploitation can be comforting and rewarding in the short term, over-reliance on it might cause you to miss out on discovering a new favorite that surpasses your current choice.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Algorithms like Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) emulate this decision-making process by strategically balancing exploration and exploitation. They quantify uncertainty through confidence intervals, prioritizing exploration of options with less information early on. This helps ensure sufficient data is gathered about each choice's potential rewards. Over time, as more information is collected, the algorithm shifts towards exploiting the options that consistently yield high rewards, optimizing cumulative gains. This dynamic strategy mirrors the process of efficiently navigating uncertainty, making well-informed decisions that maximize overall satisfaction, whether in discovering coffee shops or solving complex real-world problems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Bandit problems are inherently stochastic, as the rewards for each arm are drawn from unknown distributions. This randomness necessitates probabilistic decision-making. For instance, the observed reward $R_t$ at each time step is only a noisy approximation of the true mean reward $\mu_k$. Effective bandit algorithms must incorporate this stochasticity into their strategies to make robust decisions under uncertainty.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The basic bandit problem provides a foundational framework for decision-making under uncertainty, but real-world scenarios often demand more sophisticated adaptations. These variants and extensions expand the bandit problem to accommodate complex environments and dynamic behaviors.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">In contextual bandits, the agent is presented with additional information or "context" at each time step. For example, in an online advertising scenario, the context could include user demographics or browsing history. The reward distribution of each arm (e.g., the likelihood of a user clicking on an ad) depends on this context. The challenge is to learn a policy that maps contexts to arms to maximize cumulative rewards, requiring algorithms to balance learning both the context-arm relationships and the inherent exploration-exploitation trade-off.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Adversarial bandits introduce an element of unpredictability, where rewards are not drawn from fixed distributions but instead are determined by an adversary. This setup reflects competitive environments, such as financial markets or cybersecurity, where an opponent may strategically influence outcomes. Algorithms like EXP3 (Exponential-weight algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation) are designed to handle these challenges by assigning exponential weights to actions based on observed performance, ensuring resilience in non-stationary or adversarial conditions.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">In non-stationary bandits, reward distributions change over time, reflecting environments with evolving dynamics. For example, the popularity of a product may fluctuate with trends, requiring algorithms to adapt by discounting older observations or resetting knowledge periodically. Techniques like sliding windows or decay factors help maintain relevance in such fluid scenarios, ensuring the agent stays effective as the environment shifts.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Combinatorial bandits address situations where the decision involves selecting combinations of arms, such as allocating resources across multiple tasks or choosing a portfolio of investments. The action space in such cases grows exponentially, making the problem computationally challenging. Efficient algorithms leverage combinatorial optimization techniques to balance exploration and exploitation while managing the high-dimensional action space.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, Bayesian bandits take a probabilistic approach, using prior knowledge about the arms' reward distributions to inform decision-making. As rewards are observed, beliefs about the distributions are updated, enabling the agent to balance exploration and exploitation through posterior sampling. Thompson Sampling is a prominent Bayesian method that selects arms based on their probability of being optimal given the observed data, making it particularly effective in uncertain environments with limited prior information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Each of these extensions enriches the bandit framework, broadening its applicability to complex, real-world scenarios while introducing specialized challenges that demand innovative algorithmic solutions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Regret analysis is a cornerstone of evaluating the performance of bandit algorithms, providing a quantitative measure of how much cumulative reward is lost by not always selecting the optimal arm. Regret measures the difference between the reward that could have been achieved by consistently playing the best arm and the reward obtained by the algorithm. This metric is crucial because it captures the trade-off between exploration (gathering information about less familiar arms) and exploitation (leveraging the current knowledge to maximize rewards).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In stochastic bandits, the asymptotic lower bound on regret is known as the optimal regret. This lower bound arises because, to confidently estimate the mean rewards of all arms, a sufficient number of samples must be taken from each suboptimal arm. The regret scales with the logarithm of the time horizon $T$ and is inversely proportional to the suboptimality gap $\Delta_k$, which measures the difference between the mean reward of the optimal arm and a given suboptimal arm. Algorithms must balance exploring suboptimal arms enough to estimate their rewards while focusing on exploiting the optimal arm to minimize regret. This trade-off results in an asymptotic regret bound of $R_T = \Omega\left(\sum_{k: \mu_k < \mu^*} \frac{\ln T}{\Delta_k}\right)$, which represents the best achievable performance for stochastic bandits.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm is a prime example of an approach that achieves near-optimal regret. UCB balances exploration and exploitation by maintaining confidence intervals around the estimated mean reward of each arm. The algorithm selects the arm with the highest upper confidence bound at each step, ensuring that arms with higher uncertainty are explored more often. This balance enables UCB to achieve a regret bound of $R_T = O\left(\sum_{k: \mu_k < \mu^*} \frac{\ln T}{\Delta_k}\right)$, which matches the theoretical lower bound asymptotically. This efficiency makes UCB a powerful and widely used algorithm in bandit problems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm, while simpler, demonstrates a different trade-off. It explores randomly with a fixed probability $\epsilon$ and exploits the current best-known arm otherwise. Although easy to implement, its fixed exploration rate can lead to suboptimal performance as the time horizon increases. The regret of the basic $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm scales as $R_T = O(T^{2/3})$, which is worse than UCB for large $T$. However, its simplicity and adaptability make it a useful baseline and a practical choice in some real-world scenarios.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, regret analysis not only quantifies the effectiveness of bandit algorithms but also provides a framework for understanding the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation. Algorithms like UCB achieve near-optimal regret by dynamically adjusting their exploration based on uncertainty, while simpler heuristics like $\epsilon$-greedy offer intuitive yet less efficient solutions. These insights are fundamental to advancing decision-making systems in uncertain environments.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The following examples demonstrate practical solutions to bandit problems using Rust. First, we simulate a multi-armed bandit environment where each arm has a stochastic reward distribution. This setup forms the basis for testing different bandit strategies. Next, we implement common strategies like greedy, epsilon-greedy, and softmax to address the exploration-exploitation dilemma. Finally, we evaluate these strategies using cumulative rewards and regret to measure their performance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This example demonstrates how to model a bandit environment in Rust, where each arm has an associated reward probability. The <code>Bandit</code> struct simulates stochastic rewards using the <code>rand</code> crate.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rand::Rng;

// Define a bandit environment
struct Bandit {
    arms: Vec<f64>, // Expected rewards for each arm
}

impl Bandit {
    fn new(arms: Vec<f64>) -> Self {
        Bandit { arms }
    }

    // Simulate pulling an arm
    fn pull(&self, arm: usize) -> f64 {
        let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
        if rng.gen_range(0.0..1.0) < self.arms[arm] {
            1.0 // Reward
        } else {
            0.0 // No reward
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let bandit = Bandit::new(vec![0.2, 0.5, 0.8]); // Three arms with probabilities 0.2, 0.5, 0.8
    let reward = bandit.pull(2); // Simulate pulling the third arm
    println!("Reward: {}", reward);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>Bandit</code> struct models a multi-armed bandit environment, where each arm has a fixed reward probability. The <code>pull</code> method simulates the stochastic nature of the problem by generating a random number and comparing it to the arm's reward probability. If the random number is less than the probability, the agent receives a reward. This setup captures the uncertainty and randomness characteristic of bandit problems, allowing us to test various strategies for decision-making.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This example implements the epsilon-greedy strategy, balancing exploration and exploitation by introducing a small probability $\epsilon$ for random exploration.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rand::Rng;

fn epsilon_greedy(arms: &[f64], _counts: &mut [usize], rewards: &mut [f64], epsilon: f64) -> usize {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    if rng.gen_range(0.0..1.0) < epsilon {
        // Exploration: choose a random arm
        rng.gen_range(0..arms.len())
    } else {
        // Exploitation: choose the best-known arm
        rewards
            .iter()
            .enumerate()
            .max_by(|(_, a), (_, b)| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap())
            .map(|(index, _)| index)
            .unwrap()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let arms = vec![0.2, 0.5, 0.8];
    let mut counts = vec![0; arms.len()];
    let mut rewards = vec![0.0; arms.len()];
    let epsilon = 0.1;
    let rounds = 1000;

    for _ in 0..rounds {
        let choice = epsilon_greedy(&arms, &mut counts, &mut rewards, epsilon);
        counts[choice] += 1;
        rewards[choice] += arms[choice]; // Simulated reward
    }

    println!("Counts: {:?}", counts);
    println!("Estimated rewards: {:?}", rewards);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The epsilon-greedy strategy ensures exploration by selecting a random arm with probability $\epsilon$ and exploitation by choosing the arm with the highest observed reward otherwise. The code tracks the number of times each arm is pulled (<code>counts</code>) and the cumulative rewards for each arm (<code>rewards</code>). Over time, the strategy learns to favor the optimal arm while still occasionally exploring other arms, demonstrating the balance between exploration and exploitation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This example calculates cumulative rewards and regret, providing quantitative insights into the effectiveness of different strategies.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rand::Rng; // Import the Rng trait
use rand::thread_rng;

fn calculate_regret(arms: &[f64], counts: &[usize], optimal: f64) -> f64 {
    let total_reward: f64 = counts
        .iter()
        .zip(arms)
        .map(|(&count, &reward)| count as f64 * reward)
        .sum();
    let optimal_reward = optimal * counts.iter().sum::<usize>() as f64;
    optimal_reward - total_reward
}

fn epsilon_greedy(arms: &[f64], _counts: &mut [usize], rewards: &mut [f64], epsilon: f64) -> usize {
    let mut rng = thread_rng();
    if rng.gen_range(0.0..1.0) < epsilon {
        // Exploration: choose a random arm
        rng.gen_range(0..arms.len())
    } else {
        // Exploitation: choose the best-known arm
        rewards
            .iter()
            .enumerate()
            .max_by(|(_, a), (_, b)| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap())
            .map(|(index, _)| index)
            .unwrap()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let arms = vec![0.2, 0.5, 0.8];
    let optimal = 0.8; // The best arm's expected reward
    let mut counts = vec![0; arms.len()];
    let mut rewards = vec![0.0; arms.len()];
    let epsilon = 0.1;
    let rounds = 1000;

    for _ in 0..rounds {
        let choice = epsilon_greedy(&arms, &mut counts, &mut rewards, epsilon);
        counts[choice] += 1;

    }

    let regret = calculate_regret(&arms, &counts, optimal);
    println!("Cumulative regret: {}", regret);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>calculate_regret</code> function evaluates the performance of a strategy by computing the difference between the cumulative rewards of an optimal strategy and the chosen strategy. This metric quantifies the cost of suboptimal decisions, offering a robust way to compare strategies. The code demonstrates how the epsilon-greedy strategy minimizes regret over time by learning to favor the optimal arm.

By combining theoretical insights, intuitive explanations, and hands-on Rust implementations, this section equips readers to understand, implement, and evaluate solutions to bandit problems, building a strong foundation for more advanced RL topics.

# 3.2. Greedy and Epsilon-Greedy Algorithms
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The epsilon-greedy algorithm, illustrated by the robot in the picture, is a strategy used to balance exploration and exploitation when faced with uncertain options. In this scenario, the robot is deciding which slot machine to play to maximize its rewards. The red arrow highlights the robot's tendency to exploitâ€”the robot selects the machine with the highest average reward so far with a probability of $1 - \epsilon$ This is akin to sticking with what it already knows works well, maximizing immediate gains. However, to ensure it doesnâ€™t miss out on discovering potentially better machines, the robot occasionally explores. With a small probability $\epsilon$, it randomly picks any of the other machines (splitting $\epsilon$ equally among them, as shown by the blue arrows). This exploration allows the robot to gather new information, which could lead to better long-term outcomes. Over time, the balance between exploration and exploitation ensures the robot can identify the best machine while minimizing the risk of missing better opportunities.
</p>

        <p><span class="fw-bold ">Figure 2:</span> Illustration of epsilon greedy agent.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The epsilon-greedy algorithm, however, introduces a bit of exploration into the mix. Imagine you love the chocolate cake, but every so often, you let curiosity take over and sample something new, like the cheesecake or tiramisu. This occasional exploration (controlled by the "epsilon" factor) ensures youâ€™re not overly fixated on your current favorite and helps you discover other potentially better options. Over time, youâ€™ll have a better idea of all the desserts at the buffet, striking a balance between enjoying your current favorite and exploring for even better choices. This blend of exploration and exploitation makes epsilon-greedy a simple yet effective approach in many RL scenarios.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The greedy algorithm is one of the simplest strategies for decision-making in multi-armed bandit problems. It operates under a straightforward principle: always select the action (arm) with the highest observed average reward. Mathematically, if $\hat{\mu}_k$ represents the estimated mean reward for arm $k$, the greedy action $A_t$ at time $t$ is:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$A_t = \arg\max_k \hat{\mu}_k.$$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The greedy algorithm focuses entirely on exploitation, assuming that the current estimates of rewards accurately reflect the true distribution. This approach may perform well in environments where the optimal arm is identified early. However, in stochastic settings where rewards are uncertain, it often fails to explore under-sampled arms, risking long-term suboptimal performance. For example, if an arm with high potential rewards is sampled only once and yields a low initial reward due to randomness, the greedy algorithm may permanently overlook it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To address the limitations of the greedy algorithm, the epsilon-greedy algorithm introduces a mechanism for exploration. At each time step ttt, the algorithm selects a random action with probability $\epsilon$ (exploration) and the greedy action with probability $1 - \epsilon$ (exploitation). Formally, the action $A_t$ is chosen as:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ A_t = \begin{cases} \text{random arm, with probability } \epsilon, \\ \arg\max_k \hat{\mu}_k, \text{ with probability } 1 - \epsilon. \end{cases} $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The parameter $\epsilon$ governs the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. A higher $\epsilon$ encourages exploration, which is crucial in early stages when the reward distributions are largely unknown. Conversely, a lower $\epsilon$ favors exploitation, making it more suitable for later stages when sufficient information about the arms has been gathered.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The purely greedy approach can lead to suboptimal long-term performance in bandit problems due to its lack of exploration. Suppose an arm $k$ has a true mean reward $\mu_k$ but yields an unusually low reward in early samples. A greedy strategy may prematurely discard $k$ in favor of seemingly better arms, even if further exploration would reveal its superiority. This behavior is mathematically reflected in high regret, as the algorithm may fail to converge to the optimal arm $\mu^* = \max_k \mu_k$.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The epsilon-greedy algorithmâ€™s effectiveness lies in its ability to balance exploration and exploitation. The choice of $\epsilon$ significantly influences this balance. A large $\epsilon$ ensures that the algorithm explores extensively, reducing the risk of overlooking promising arms. However, excessive exploration delays convergence to the optimal arm. Conversely, a small $\epsilon$ accelerates exploitation but risks prematurely settling on suboptimal arms.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To understand this trade-off, consider regret, defined as:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ R_T = \sum_{t=1}^T \mu^* - \sum_{t=1}^T \mathbb{E}[R_t]. $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A high $\epsilon$ minimizes regret early by exploring all arms but may lead to slower convergence later. The optimal value of $\epsilon$ depends on the problem's time horizon $T$ and the variability in rewards.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A dynamic approach to $\epsilon$, known as annealing, gradually decreases the exploration rate over time. This ensures that the agent explores extensively in the early stages but shifts toward exploitation as more information is gathered. A common annealing schedule reduces $\epsilon$ as a function of time $t$:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ \epsilon_t = \frac{\epsilon_0}{1 + \alpha t}, $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $\epsilon_0$ is the initial exploration rate and $\alpha$ controls the rate of decay. Annealing allows the epsilon-greedy algorithm to adapt to the learning process, balancing short-term exploration with long-term convergence.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The following implementations demonstrate greedy and epsilon-greedy algorithms in Rust. We simulate a multi-armed bandit problem, explore the effects of different $\epsilon$ values, and implement an annealing schedule to dynamically adjust $\epsilon$. These implementations showcase the practical trade-offs between exploration and exploitation in decision-making. The code below demonstrates the greedy algorithm, which always selects the arm with the highest observed reward.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn greedy_action(rewards: &[f64]) -> usize {
    rewards
        .iter()
        .enumerate()
        .max_by(|(_, a), (_, b)| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap())
        .map(|(index, _)| index)
        .unwrap()
}

fn main() {
    let rewards = vec![0.2, 0.5, 0.8]; // Observed average rewards for three arms
    let choice = greedy_action(&rewards); // Select the best arm
    println!("Greedy choice: Arm {}", choice);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>greedy_action</code> function selects the arm with the highest observed average reward using Rustâ€™s iterator combinators. While simple and computationally efficient, this approach lacks any exploration mechanism, making it prone to suboptimal performance in stochastic environments.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This example balances exploration and exploitation using the epsilon-greedy strategy.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rand::Rng;

fn epsilon_greedy(rewards: &[f64], epsilon: f64) -> usize {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    if rng.gen_range(0.0..1.0) < epsilon {
        // Exploration: choose a random arm
        rng.gen_range(0..rewards.len())
    } else {
        // Exploitation: choose the best arm
        rewards
            .iter()
            .enumerate()
            .max_by(|(_, a), (_, b)| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap())
            .map(|(index, _)| index)
            .unwrap()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rewards = vec![0.2, 0.5, 0.8]; // Observed average rewards for three arms
    let epsilon = 0.1; // Exploration rate
    let choice = epsilon_greedy(&rewards, epsilon); // Select an arm
    println!("Epsilon-greedy choice: Arm {}", choice);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>epsilon_greedy</code> function introduces randomness by choosing a random arm with probability $\epsilon$. This ensures that the algorithm continues to explore under-sampled arms while exploiting the best-known arm most of the time. The balance between exploration and exploitation is controlled by the $\epsilon$ parameter.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This example incorporates an annealing schedule to dynamically adjust $\epsilon$ over time.

The <code>annealing_epsilon</code> function computes a dynamically decreasing $\epsilon$ based on the time step $t$. This approach ensures that the agent explores extensively during early iterations but gradually shifts toward exploitation as it gains more information. The annealing schedule strikes a balance between short-term learning and long-term performance.

# 3.3. Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm is a clever and systematic way of addressing the challenge of exploration versus exploitation in multi-armed bandit problems. Think of it as trying to pick the best restaurant in a new city. While some restaurants might have great reviews (high observed rewards), there are others you haven't tried yet, and they might surprise you. UCB tackles this by assigning a "confidence score" to each restaurant based on two factors: how good the restaurant appears to be so far (observed reward) and how uncertain you are about its quality (how often you've tried it). If a restaurant has been tried a lot and consistently delivers good food, UCB will lean toward exploiting it. But if another restaurant hasnâ€™t been tried much, UCB gives it a higher confidence score to encourage you to explore it, just in case it turns out to be even better. Over time, this method ensures that you donâ€™t stick with familiar choices too early or miss out on hidden gems, achieving a balanced and informed decision-making process.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, as illustrated in the image, balances exploration and exploitation by combining two key components for decision-making. The first component, $Q_t(a)$, represents the estimated reward for each action $a$, reflecting the known performance of that option. The second component, $c \sqrt{\frac{\log(t)}{N_{t-1}(a)}}$, accounts for uncertainty, increasing when an action aaa has been chosen fewer times ($N_{t-1}(a)$) or when fewer rounds ($t$) have occurred. Actions with smaller uncertainty intervals (e.g., actions frequently sampled) have narrower confidence bounds, emphasizing exploitation, while actions with larger uncertainty (e.g., less sampled or newer options) are prioritized for exploration. UCB ensures a systematic exploration of underexplored actions early on, while gradually focusing on actions that consistently yield high rewards as more data is gathered. This dynamic interplay makes UCB highly effective for balancing risk and reward in multi-armed bandit problems.

    </div>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Imagine youâ€™re choosing between restaurants. Some are familiar and offer consistent experiences, while others are new and untested. The UCB algorithm balances revisiting your favorite spots (exploitation) with trying new places (exploration) by giving more weight to the uncertainty of the untested options. Mathematically, at each time step $t$, the algorithm selects the action $a_t$ as:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ a_t = \arg\max_k \left( \hat{\mu}_k + c \sqrt{\frac{\ln t}{n_k}} \right), $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">$\hat{\mu}_k$ is the estimated mean reward of arm $k$.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">$n_k$ is the number of times arm $k$ has been pulled.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">$t$ is the total number of trials so far.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">$c$ is a constant that determines the exploration strength.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The term $\sqrt{\frac{\ln t}{n_k}}$ adjusts the confidence interval for each arm. Arms with low $n_k$ (i.e., less exploration) have larger confidence intervals, prioritizing them for exploration. Over time, as $n_k$ increases, the confidence interval shrinks, reflecting growing certainty in the arm's estimated reward.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Thompson Sampling takes a probabilistic approach to balancing exploration and exploitation, rooted in Bayesian inference. Instead of relying on fixed confidence intervals, it models the uncertainty of each armâ€™s reward using probability distributions. At each time step, the algorithm samples from these distributions to select an arm, naturally encouraging exploration of uncertain arms and exploitation of well-understood ones.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Imagine youâ€™re betting on horses, and you have some initial beliefs (priors) about each horseâ€™s chances of winning. After observing several races, you update these beliefs based on performance (posterior distributions). When deciding which horse to bet on, you sample from your updated beliefs. Horses with both high potential and uncertainty are more likely to be chosen, reflecting Thompson Samplingâ€™s balance between exploration and exploitation. These beliefs are shown in the image as the prior distributions for each arm (horse). After observing several races, you update your beliefs based on the horsesâ€™ performanceâ€”successful races sharpen the distribution peaks (like the blue horse), while poorly performing horses retain flatter, more uncertain distributions (like the green horse). Each time you decide which horse to bet on, you sample from these updated beliefs. This approach ensures that you not only favor horses with strong evidence of success but also occasionally bet on those with higher uncertainty, as they might reveal unexpected potential. Thompson Sampling works exactly like this, balancing exploration of less-tested options and exploitation of known performers, leading to smarter decisions over time.
</p>

    <div class="rounded p-4 position-relative overflow-hidden border-1 text-center" style="width: 90%">

        <p><span class="fw-bold ">Figure 4:</span> An illustration of Thompson sampling method.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Formally, Thompson Sampling models the reward $R_k$ for each arm $k$ as a random variable with a prior distribution, such as Beta for binary rewards. At each time $t$, the algorithm:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Samples $\theta_k$ from the posterior distribution of arm $k$.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Selects the arm $A_t = \arg\max_k \theta_k$.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For binary rewards (success or failure), the Beta distribution is commonly used, and the posterior update is:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ \text{Beta}(\alpha_k, \beta_k) \rightarrow \text{Beta}(\alpha_k + \text{successes}, \beta_k + \text{failures}), $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $\alpha_k$ and $\beta_k$ represent the number of successes and failures, respectively. This Bayesian framework enables Thompson Sampling to dynamically adjust its exploration based on observed outcomes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Both UCB and Thompson Sampling are theoretically guaranteed to achieve logarithmic regret over time, meaning their performance approaches that of the optimal strategy as the time horizon $T$ increases. Regret, a key metric in bandit problems, measures the difference between the cumulative reward of the optimal strategy and the chosen strategy:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ R_T = \sum_{t=1}^T \mu^* - \sum_{t=1}^T \mathbb{E}[R_t], $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $\mu^*$ is the reward of the best arm.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The logarithmic regret of UCB and Thompson Sampling ensures that they perform near-optimally in the long run, with their exploration strategies focusing on under-sampled arms only when necessary. For UCB, this is achieved by systematically narrowing confidence intervals. For Thompson Sampling, the posterior distributions naturally shift toward the true reward probabilities, reducing unnecessary exploration.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The confidence interval in UCB plays a pivotal role in its exploration strategy. The term $\sqrt{\frac{\ln t}{n_k}}$ is analogous to a measure of doubt about an armâ€™s reward. Arms with fewer samples have wider intervals, signaling greater uncertainty. As more data is collected ($n_k$ increases), this term diminishes, indicating growing confidence in the estimated reward.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Imagine youâ€™re reviewing movies on a streaming platform. New releases with few reviews have uncertain ratings, warranting exploration to improve the platformâ€™s recommendations. Older movies with many reviews have stable ratings, requiring less exploration. UCB dynamically adjusts its exploration effort based on this confidence, ensuring efficient resource allocation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Thompson Samplingâ€™s Bayesian nature offers several advantages. By maintaining a distribution over possible rewards for each arm, it captures both the uncertainty and observed performance of the arms. For instance:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Arms with limited data retain wider distributions, reflecting uncertainty.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Arms with consistent outcomes develop narrower distributions, emphasizing exploitation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This probabilistic framework allows Thompson Sampling to seamlessly incorporate new information and make decisions that balance exploration and exploitation without requiring explicit confidence intervals.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The following implementations showcase UCB and Thompson Sampling algorithms in Rust. The first example demonstrates how UCB calculates confidence bounds for action selection. The second example implements Thompson Sampling using Beta distributions for posterior updates. Finally, both algorithms are compared in a simulated bandit environment to analyze their performance in terms of cumulative rewards and regret.

# 3.4. Contextual Bandits
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The contextual bandit framework, as illustrated in the image, showcases how decision-making is influenced by the surrounding context. Imagine an agent tasked with recommending items on a webpage. The environment presents different states, such as "At Work" or "At Home," which define the context. For each context, the agent selects an actionâ€”showing specific items on the webpageâ€”and receives a reward based on the effectiveness of the recommendation. For instance, at work, showing item 2 on webpage A earns $22, while at home, showing the same item earns $44. This demonstrates how the reward is conditional on both the action taken and the contextual information. The goal of the agent is to learn a policy that dynamically adapts its decisions to maximize cumulative rewards by leveraging the context, making contextual bandits a powerful tool for personalized and adaptive decision-making.
</p>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="rounded p-4 position-relative overflow-hidden border-1 text-center" style="width: 100%">

        <p><span class="fw-bold ">Figure 5:</span> Illustration of contextual bandit method.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The contextual bandit problem represents a sophisticated extension of the traditional multi-armed bandit framework, integrating contextual information to enable more informed decision-making. Unlike the basic multi-armed bandit setting, where the agent selects actions based solely on past rewards, the contextual bandit incorporates an additional layer of complexity: the context. At each time step $t$, the agent receives a context vector $\mathbf{x}_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$, representing the state or features of the current environment. Based on this context, the agent selects an action $A_t \in \mathcal{A}$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of available actions, and subsequently observes a reward $R_t(A_t)$. The objective is to learn a policy $\pi: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ that maps contexts to actions in a way that maximizes the cumulative reward over $T$ time steps:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ G_T = \sum_{t=1}^T R_t(A_t). $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This framework significantly expands the scope of the bandit problem, enabling agents to make decisions that are not only influenced by the history of actions and rewards but also tailored to the specific circumstances of each decision.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A compelling analogy for the contextual bandit is personalized advertising. Imagine an online platform that must decide which advertisement to display to users visiting its website. Each user brings specific attributes, such as browsing history, geographic location, and expressed interestsâ€”this is the context $\mathbf{x}_t$. The platform acts as the agent, selecting an advertisement (action $A_t$) to display, and the reward $R_t(A_t)$ could be whether the user clicks on the ad. Unlike traditional bandits that treat all users identically, contextual bandits allow the platform to leverage user-specific information to make tailored decisions. For instance, showing travel-related ads to users who have recently searched for flights is more likely to result in a click compared to generic ads. By continually learning the relationship between user contexts and the effectiveness of different ads, the platform improves its decision-making over time, maximizing engagement and revenue.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
From a mathematical standpoint, the contextual bandit problem balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off in the presence of rich contextual information. For a given context-action pair $(\mathbf{x}_t, A_t)$, the expected reward is modeled as $\mathbb{E}[R_t(A_t) | \mathbf{x}_t, A_t] = f(\mathbf{x}_t, A_t)$, where $f$ is an unknown function. The challenge lies in estimating $f$ accurately while actively sampling actions to gather informative data. Many contextual bandit algorithms, such as LinUCB (Linear Upper Confidence Bound), assume that $f$ is linear and approximate the reward function as:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$\hat{R}_t(A_t) = \mathbf{x}_t^\top \theta_{A_t},$$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $\theta_{A_t}$ is a parameter vector specific to action $A_t$. The agent maintains uncertainty estimates for each action's parameter vector, enabling it to explore actions with high uncertainty while exploiting those with high estimated rewards. This is analogous to personalized advertising platforms experimenting with less-tested ads for new user profiles while capitalizing on well-performing ads for familiar contexts.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Beyond advertising, the contextual bandit framework applies to diverse real-world scenarios, including recommendation systems, healthcare (e.g., recommending treatments based on patient data), and finance (e.g., portfolio allocation based on market conditions). The ability to adapt actions to contextual signals makes this approach indispensable for decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments. By leveraging the interplay between context, action, and reward, contextual bandits push the boundaries of intelligent decision-making.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
While contextual bandits extend traditional bandits by incorporating context, they differ fundamentally from full reinforcement learning (RL) problems due to the absence of sequential dependencies. In contextual bandits, each decision is independent, and the chosen action affects only the immediate reward. Formally, the agent solves a sequence of independent optimization problems:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ \text{Given } \mathbf{x}_t, \text{ choose } A_t \text{ to maximize } \mathbb{E}[R_t(A_t) | \mathbf{x}_t]. $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In full RL, however, actions influence not only immediate rewards but also future states and available actions, creating a complex feedback loop. This distinction is analogous to playing a one-off game versus a multi-stage tournament. In a one-off game (contextual bandits), your strategy depends solely on the current situation. In a tournament (full RL), you must also consider how your actions affect your position in subsequent rounds.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Contextual bandits are widely used in applications where decisions are influenced by contextual information. Some notable examples include:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Personalized Recommendations: E-commerce platforms leverage contextual bandits to recommend products based on user preferences. For instance, recommending a smartphone (action) based on browsing history, price sensitivity, and brand affinity (context) aims to maximize purchases (reward).</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Adaptive Clinical Trials: In healthcare, contextual bandits allocate treatments (actions) to patients based on their characteristics (context), such as age, medical history, and genetic markers, to maximize recovery rates (reward) while minimizing harmful side effects.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Dynamic Pricing: Online retailers use contextual bandits to optimize prices (actions) based on market trends, competitor prices, and customer behavior (context), aiming to maximize revenue (reward).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
These applications highlight the versatility of contextual bandits in dynamically adapting decisions based on contextual cues.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In contextual bandits, the additional information provided by the context $\mathbf{x}_t$ enables the agent to tailor its actions to specific situations, improving decision quality. The reward for an action depends on both the action itself and the context:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ R_t(A_t) = f(\mathbf{x}_t, A_t) + \epsilon, $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $f(\mathbf{x}_t, A_t)$ represents the expected reward given the context and action, and $\epsilon$ is random noise. This relationship allows the agent to capture patterns between contexts and rewards, enabling more precise predictions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
An analogy is a chef designing meals for customers. The customerâ€™s preferences and dietary restrictions (context) influence their satisfaction (reward) with a given dish (action). A chef who ignores this context might offer random dishes, while one who considers preferences can craft meals that delight customers.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Despite their advantages, contextual bandits present several challenges:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Efficient Context Processing: Processing high-dimensional context vectors $\mathbf{x}_t$ requires computational efficiency. As the dimensionality increases, algorithms must handle the curse of dimensionality, where irrelevant features dilute the predictive power.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">High-Dimensional Contexts: In many real-world scenarios, context vectors may include hundreds or thousands of features. Identifying and leveraging the most relevant features is critical for efficient decision-making.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Feature Selection and Representation: Choosing the right features and representing them effectively can significantly improve the performance of contextual bandit algorithms. For instance, combining raw features into meaningful representations (e.g., embeddings in machine learning) can enhance predictive accuracy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
These challenges are akin to solving a puzzle with extra pieces that donâ€™t belongâ€”understanding which pieces matter and how they fit together is essential for success.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The following examples implement a contextual bandit algorithm in Rust. The first example integrates context into the decision-making process, demonstrating how rewards depend on both actions and contexts.

Finally, the third example applies contextual bandits to a personalized recommendation problem, showcasing their real-world applicability.
