<em>"RLVR - Reinforcement Learning via Rust" is a comprehensive guide that seamlessly integrates the foundational theories of reinforcement learning with practical implementation using the Rust programming language. Organized into four parts, the book begins with Part I: The Foundations, covering essential topics such as Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Mathematical Foundations, Bandit Algorithms and Exploration-Exploitation Dilemmas, and Dynamic Programming in Reinforcement Learning. It then advances to Part II: The Algorithms, which delves into Monte Carlo Methods, Temporal-Difference Learning, Function Approximation Techniques, Eligibility Traces, Policy Gradient Methods, and Model-Based Reinforcement Learning. Part III: The Multi-Agents explores multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) through chapters on Introduction to Multi-Agent Systems, Game Theory for MARL, Learning in Multi-Agent Systems, and Foundational MARL Algorithms. The final section, Part IV: Deep RL Models, addresses advanced topics including Deep Learning Foundations, Deep Reinforcement Learning Models, Deep Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning, Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Simulation Environments. Enhanced by hands-on projects and capstone examples, RLVR equips students, researchers, and professionals with the knowledge and tools to master reinforcement learning and make meaningful contributions using Rust, supported by insights from Stanford University's prominent CS234: Reinforcement Learning course.</em>
