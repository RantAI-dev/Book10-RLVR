<em>Part II of RLVR</em> delves into the algorithms that power modern reinforcement learning (RL). This section begins with Monte Carlo Methods, which utilize sampling to estimate value functions and optimize decision-making in environments with unknown dynamics. Temporal-Difference (TD) Learning follows, blending the sampling flexibility of Monte Carlo methods with the bootstrapping efficiency of dynamic programming to enable real-time learning. Function Approximation Techniques are introduced as a solution to challenges posed by large or continuous state spaces, leveraging tools such as linear models and neural networks to approximate value functions. The section then explores Eligibility Traces, an extension of TD learning that accelerates reward propagation by combining principles of Monte Carlo and TD methods. Policy Gradient Methods take center stage as a direct approach to policy optimization, emphasizing gradient-based strategies for continuous and stochastic action spaces. Finally, Model-Based Reinforcement Learning is presented, demonstrating how environmental models can enhance decision-making and improve algorithm efficiency. Each chapter includes step-by-step Rust implementations, bridging the gap between theory and practical application.

            Begin with Monte Carlo Methods, understanding their role in estimating value functions through sampled experiences. Practice implementing these methods in Rust to internalize their application in environments with unknown dynamics. Next, focus on Temporal-Difference (TD) Learning, studying its hybrid approach that integrates Monte Carlo and dynamic programming techniques. Hands-on coding of TD methods will help reinforce these concepts. When approaching Function Approximation Techniques, explore the use of linear regression and neural networks, balancing accuracy and efficiency in large state spaces. Dive into Eligibility Traces to understand how they accelerate learning by efficiently propagating rewards. For Policy Gradient Methods, implement basic strategies to directly optimize policies in continuous action spaces. Finally, explore Model-Based RL by using environmental models for planning and decision-making. By systematically working through these algorithms and their Rust implementations, youâ€™ll develop a thorough understanding of the core RL methods.

            In Monte Carlo Methods, revisit the fundamentals of using sampled experiences for decision-making in environments with unknown dynamics, implementing these in Rust to explore their practical applications. Temporal-Difference Learning offers a real-time approach that is both flexible and efficientâ€”practice coding TD methods to understand their hybrid nature. For Function Approximation Techniques, apply linear models and neural networks to address large state spaces, ensuring your implementations balance precision and performance. Incorporate Eligibility Traces to enhance TD methods, observing how this approach improves learning efficiency. Policy Gradient Methods provide a pathway to directly optimizing policies; experiment with gradient-based algorithms to address continuous action spaces. Lastly, dive into Model-Based RL to harness the power of environmental models, experimenting with planning strategies and their Rust-based implementations. By engaging with each algorithm, youâ€™ll refine your ability to tackle diverse RL challenges in real-world settings.
